        <h2>Medical <span>Consultant</span></h2>
        <p> Dr. Mardach single handedly developed from inception a medical service for the diagnosis and treatment of metabolic patients and founded the innovative Kaiser Regional Metabolic Center in Los Angeles. The center quickly became a model of medical care for chronic, complex, and frequently non-treatable inborn errors of metabolism.<br><br> Dr. Mardach also coordinated the newborn screening program at Kaiser. The program covers over 600,000 newborns each year and allows for early diagnosis and treatment of conditions like congenital endocrinopathies, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, thalassemia, congenital hearing loss, and a long list of metabolic conditions.</p>
