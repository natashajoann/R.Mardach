    <h2>Clinical and Biochemical <span>Geneticist</span></h2>
    <p> Dr. Mardach provides clinical genetic assessments to pediatric and adult patients at the UC Davis Mind Institute Genomics Clinic. In collaboration with UC Davis Health neurologists, she has begun a neurogenetic service and plans to work with other departments integrating genomics into other medical specialties.<br><br> In addition to her work at UC Davis, she is pioneering telehealth genomic education to advance genetic and genomic knowledge among international health providers. She is also participating in building the Genomics Telemedicine Program that will increase access to specialized care for individuals living in distant geographical areas. </p>
